# Pivot Settings (clusters and dataSources) can be stored in three ways.
# Choose just one option and comment out the others.
#
#  1) Stored in a file in varDir, editable at runtime with Settings View. Not suitable for running in a cluster.
#  2) Stored in a database, editable at runtime with Settings View. Works well with a cluster of Pivot servers.
#

#
# 1) File-backed settings (not suitable for running in a cluster)
